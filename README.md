A modular framework for creating and evolving LLM-based agents that solve complex problems through iterative improvement, self-play, and evolutionary algorithms. LLM Trainer provides a flexible architecture for research and development in agent-based problem solving, optimization, and AI evolution.

## Overview
LLM Trainer (llm-trainer) is designed to support:
- Defining and decomposing complex problems
- Evolving and training LLM-based agents
- Benchmarking and evaluating agent performance
- Scalable, extensible, and reproducible research

> **Status**: This project is currently in development. APIs may change significantly between versions.

### Why LLM Trainer?
Traditional AI systems often struggle with complex, open-ended problems that require creative thinking, adaptation, and exploration of large solution spaces. LLM Trainer addresses these challenges by combining:

* **Evolutionary computation** - Explore diverse solution spaces efficiently
* **LLM capabilities** - Leverage large language models' reasoning and generative abilities
* **Self-play mechanisms** - Develop increasingly sophisticated strategies through competition
* **Meta-learning** - Learn how to learn and adapt to new problem domains

```

The framework follows a cyclical flow where:
1. Problems are defined and structured
2. Agent populations attempt solutions
3. Evolution and search mechanisms improve solution quality
4. Training refines agent capabilities
5. Evaluation provides feedback
6. Data management preserves knowledge for future iterations

## Key Design Principles

- **Modularity**: Each component is independently replaceable
- **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling across distributed systems
- **Extensibility**: Plugin architecture for new algorithms/models
- **Reproducibility**: Deterministic experiments with version control
- **Efficiency**: Parallel processing and resource optimization

## Success Metrics

- **Performance**: Solution quality on benchmark problems
- **Efficiency**: Time and compute resources required
- **Generalization**: Transfer learning to new problem domains
- **Scalability**: Performance with increasing problem complexity
- **Robustness**: Stability across different configurations

## Getting Started

TODO : ElodinLaarz - Later.

## Contributing

I'm just doing this for fun. I will probably forget this exists in
two weeks.

I would just fork it and use it elsewhere.
